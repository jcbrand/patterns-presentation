<!-- NOTES:
    What is Patternslib?
      Depends on who you are.
        Designer:
            A way to add interactivity to your prototype without having to learn or write Javascript.
        Developer:
            A way to write, encapsulate, package and expose front-end Javascript features to designers.

    How do Patterns work?
        Depends on who you are.
            Designer:
                Create normal HTML markup, but add special classes and data-* attributes to exposes new non-standard features
                    Like?
                        * Tabs
                        * Rich text editing
                        * Ajax page loading
                        * Form validation
                        * ... Pretty much anything that can be done in JS
            Developer:
                Create JS modules which configure a DOM parser to check for a certain class name and (optionally) data-* attributes.
                Such a module will automatically be called when parser finds the markup in the DOM.

    How do you create a new Pattern?
        - Yeoman
        - Require.js
        - NPM
        - Bower.json

    Advantages of Patterns:
        If done right, allows graceful degradation
        Small and easy to grok. (Compare size of patterns core with other frameworks)
        Pay for what you eat, use only the patterns you need, discard the rest.

    Comparison with other JS frameworks or concepts:
        Main difference between Patterns and other frameworks is the "Ausgangspunkt".
        Seen from the designer, not the developer.

        Backbone:
            You can use Backbone in Patterns.
        Angular.js:
            Has ng- "directives", but is very developer-sentric and not accessible to designers at all.
        React.js:
            Don't have direct experience, but could be used. ???

        Webcomponents:
            Definition:
                "A standardised non-obtrusive way to write encapsulated functionality in the form of a component.
                Each component can hold its own HTML markup, styles and JavaScript code without the risk of breaking things around it."
                Source: http://www.revillweb.com/articles/why-web-components-are-important/

            Very similar to one usecase of Patterns, which is to embed enhanced
            widgets into the DOM.

            Has some advantages:
                - W3C standard (http://www.w3.org/standards/techs/components)
                - Shadow DOM
                    The markup for such a widget is encapsulated in its own
                    DOM, with its own CSS rules, which doesn't affect the
                    "normal" DOM around it.

            However, no IE or Safari support (although polyfills exist).
            https://github.com/WebComponents/webcomponentsjs

            No reason why you can't use both Webcomponents and Patterns in a
            single project. We could also perhaps add support for Webcomponents
            or individual features such as Shadow DOM to Patterns. Needs some
            more investigation.

    Ideas:
        Demo loading of Markdown
        Demo code syntax highlighting

<!--
    Body element is used by impress.js to set some useful class names, that will allow you to detect
    the support and state of the presentation in CSS or other scripts.

    First very useful class name is `impress-not-supported`. This class means, that browser doesn't
    support features required by impress.js, so you should apply some fallback styles in your CSS.
    It's not necessary to add it manually on this element. If the script detects that browser is not
    good enough it will add this class, but keeping it in HTML means that users without JavaScript
    will also get fallback styles.

    When impress.js script detects that browser supports all required features, this class name will
    be removed.

    The class name on body element also depends on currently active presentation step. More details about
    it can be found later, when `hint` element is being described.
-->
<body class="impress-not-supported">

<!-- This fallback message is only visible when there is `impress-not-supported` class on body. -->
<div class="fallback-message">
    <p>Your browser <b>doesn't support the features required</b> by impress.js, so you are presented with a simplified version of this presentation.</p>
    <p>For the best experience please use the latest <b>Chrome</b>, <b>Safari</b> or <b>Firefox</b> browser.</p>
</div>

<!--
    Now that's the core element used by impress.js.

    That's the wrapper for your presentation steps. In this element all the impress.js magic happens.
    It doesn't have to be a `<div>`. Only `id` is important here as that's how the script find it.

    You probably won't need it now, but there are some configuration options that can be set on this element.

    To change the duration of the transition between slides use `data-transition-duration="2000"` giving it
    a number of ms. It defaults to 1000 (1s).

    You can also control the perspective with `data-perspective="500"` giving it a number of pixels.
    It defaults to 1000. You can set it to 0 if you don't want any 3D effects.
    If you are willing to change this value make sure you understand how CSS perspective works:

        The `id` attribute of the step element is used to identify it in the URL, but it's optional.
        If it is not defined, it will get a default value of `step-N` where N is a number of slide.

        So in the example below it'll be `step-2`.

        The hash part of the url when this step is active will be `#/step-2`.

        You can also use `#step-2` in a link, to point directly to this particular step.

        Please note, that while `#/step-2` (with slash) would also work in a link it's not recommended.
        Using classic `id`-based links like `#step-2` makes these links usable also in fallback mode.

        This step here doesn't introduce anything new when it comes to data attributes, but you
        should notice in the demo that some words of this text are being animated.
        It's a very basic CSS transition that is applied to the elements when this step element is
        reached.

        At the very beginning of the presentation all step elements are given the class of `future`.
        It means that they haven't been visited yet.

        When the presentation moves to given step `future` is changed to `present` class name.
        That's how animation on this step works - text moves when the step has `present` class.

        Finally when the step is left the `present` class is removed from the element and `past`
        class is added.

        So basically every step element has one of three classes: `future`, `present` and `past`.
        Only one current step has the `present` class.

            You can not only position element in 3D, but also rotate it around any axis.
            So this one here will get rotated by -40 degrees (40 degrees anticlockwise) around X axis and
            10 degrees (clockwise) around Y axis.

            You can of course rotate it around Z axis with `data-rotate-z` - it has exactly the same effect
            as `data-rotate` (these two are basically aliases).

        So to summarize of all the possible attributes used to position presentation steps, we have:

        * `data-x`, `data-y`, `data-z` - they define the position of **the center** of step element on
            the canvas in pixels; their default value is 0;
        * `data-rotate-x`, `data-rotate-y`, 'data-rotate-z`, `data-rotate` - they define the rotation of
            the element around given axis in degrees; their default value is 0; `data-rotate` and `data-rotate-z`
            are exactly the same;
        * `data-scale` - defines the scale of step element; default value is 1

        These values are used by impress.js in CSS transformation functions, so for more information consult
        CSS transfrom docs: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/transform
